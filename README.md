# Infrastructure

AWS Infrastructure for webapp

```
Create network infrastructure using terraform
```

# Terraform Initialize

```
The terraform init command is used to initialize a working directory containing Terraform configuration files. This is the first command that should be run after writing a new Terraform configuration or cloning an existing one from version control. It is safe to run this command multiple times.

terraform init
```

# Terraform Plan

```
The terraform plan command is used to create an execution plan. Terraform performs a refresh, unless explicitly disabled, and then determines what actions are necessary to achieve the desired state specified in the configuration files.

terraform plan
```

# Terraform Apply

```
To apply the changes required to reach the desired state of the configuration, or the pre-determined set of actions generated by a terraform plan execution plan

terraform apply -var 'VPC_cidrBlock=<10.0.0.0/16'> -auto-approve
```

# Terraform Destroy

```
To destroy the Terraform-managed infrastructure.

terraform destroy -auto-approve
```
